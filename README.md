Vanish opens the right pages, drafts the right letters, and records HMAC-signed audit proof on your machine. **You're the one legally submitting** — so captchas, ToS gates, and account-verification loops all work correctly. Vanish does not auto-submit destructive actions on your behalf.

For why this matters in 2026 — the AI training inversion, the face-search broker explosion, and how Vanish compares to DeleteMe / Optery / Incogni — see [vs. Competitors](#vs-competitors) below.

## What you actually get

Vanish delivers value in three acts. Each command in the [capability matrix](#capability-matrix) below maps to one of these.

### 1. Find it

Priority-ranked exposure across data brokers, AI platforms, face-search services, and (for sites you own) training datasets. **This is triage, not confirmation.** `scan`, `ai-scan`, and `face-scan` give you a ranked list of *where to act first* — not proof that any specific record exists. `verify` is what answers "is the record actually there?".

### 2. Act on it

Real removal and objection-request flows. `opt-out`, `ai-opt-out`, and `face-opt-out` open the broker's actual opt-out page, pre-fill what they accept, and walk you through captchas, ID verification, and ToS gates. `takedown` drafts DMCA / NCII / cease-and-desist letters. `third-party-ai` generates jurisdiction-cited objection letters for AI used *by other people on you*. **You're the one submitting** — so the broker's response works correctly.

### 3. Verify it and keep proof

`verify` re-checks brokers via HTTP liveness (automated for the 58 with adapters, reminder-only for AI/face). `report` builds an HMAC-signed audit chain you can keep locally and produce as evidence under GDPR Article 21, CCPA, or in legal disputes. **The proof stays on your machine.** Nothing gets uploaded to a backend — there is no backend.

---

## Capability matrix

Three stability tiers. **Core** are stable, in the hero, and what most users should run. **Specialist** are stable but narrower (NCII takedown, dataset-membership probes, third-party AI letters). **Labs / Research** is either experimental infrastructure (`b1-live`), low-confidence research probes (`llm-memory-check`), or UX layers that aren't capabilities themselves (`wizard`, `dashboard`).

**Evidence legend** — `A`: result is locally verifiable (audit chain, HTTP liveness, generated artifact). `B`: action is provable, result needs follow-up confirmation. `C`: classification / triage / user-self-confirmation. `D`: research probe, not a strong claim.

### Core (stable, in hero)

| Command | What you get | Type | Evidence | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scan` | Priority-ranked broker exposure list | Risk discovery | C | 210 brokers |
| `opt-out` | Real removal requests submitted via your browser | Removal request | B | 58 brokers |
| `verify` | Answer to "did the removal go through?" | Outcome check | A (HTTP) / B (manual) | All kinds |
| `report` | Local evidence chain + appeal material | Evidence output | A | All kinds |
| `ai-scan` | Which platforms default-train on your data | Risk discovery | C | 30 platforms |
| `ai-opt-out` | Future training/improvement toggles flipped off | Future-exposure reduction | B/C | 26 platforms |
| `face-scan` | Self-check whether your face is searchable | Risk discovery | C | 8 services |
| `face-opt-out` | Real removal requests to face-search services | Removal request | B | 8 services |

### Specialist (stable, narrower scope)

| Command | What you get | Type | Evidence | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `takedown` | DMCA / NCII removal letters + StopNCII hash registration | Removal request | B | 12 leak sites + StopNCII + Google form |
| `dataset-check` | Whether content appears in training data / index | Risk discovery | B (Common Crawl) / C (others) | 8 datasets |
| `third-party-ai` | Objection letters to employer / 3rd-party AI use | Future-exposure reduction | B | 22 tools, 5 contexts, 5 letter templates |
| `clean-ai-history` | Local AI-tool conversation hygiene | Local hygiene | B/C | 9 tools (4 local + 5 web) |

### Labs / Research (not core promises)

| Command | What you get | Type | Evidence | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `llm-memory-check` | Probe of whether models seem to have memorized you | Research probe | D | 2 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) |
| `b1-live` | Live-adapter HTTP submission (infrastructure test) | Experimental capability | D | 8 brokers (Spokeo only verifiable in MVP; rest dry-run — see [`REAL_LOOP_STATUS.md`](REAL_LOOP_STATUS.md)) |
| `wizard` | Interactive scan→review→cleanup flow | UX layer | C | All kinds |
| `dashboard` | Static HTML dashboard from queue state | UX layer | C | All kinds |

**Internal helpers** (not user-facing capabilities, documented in [Commands](#commands)): `b1-demo` (B1 runner demo mode), `queue` (queue list / retry / resolve), `dashboard:watch` (auto-refresh dashboard data), `cleanup` (low-level dry-run alternative to `opt-out`).

### Sample output

```
# Privacy Scan Report
Scan ID: scan_1776429838547_9dd0ef7b
Identity: A. Lovelace

## Privacy Score: 63/100 (HIGH RISK)

[█████████████░░░░░░░] 63/100

## Exposure Summary
- Total brokers scanned: 210
- Likely exposed: 115
- Possibly exposed: 95

## Risk Distribution
- Critical: 95
- High: 20
- Moderate: 65

## Priority Recommendations
1. [CRITICAL] Remove from 70 people-search brokers
2. [CRITICAL] Remove from 18 background-check brokers
3. [HIGH] Remove from 7 identity-resolution brokers
4. [HIGH] Remove from 21 public-records brokers
```

---

## How it works

### 1. Scan (10 seconds, zero API calls)

Heuristic scanner estimates your exposure across 210 brokers using a 5-factor confidence algorithm:
- **Data-type coverage**: does the broker collect what you have?
- **Category risk**: people-search = critical, property-records = low
- **Jurisdiction match**: US brokers for US users, etc.
- **Broker reach**: category penetration
- **Opt-out complexity**: mail-only brokers likely still have your data

All computation is local. Nothing leaves your machine.

### 2. Review

Privacy score (0-100), per-broker risk tiers (`critical` / `high` / `moderate` / `low`), and prioritized recommendations grouped by category.

### 3. Remove

18-step conversational wizard submits opt-out requests:

```
SCAN_WELCOME → SCAN_INPUT → SCAN_RUNNING → SCAN_REPORT → SCAN_HANDOFF
  ↓ (cleanup branch)
WELCOME → GOAL → SCOPE → INPUT → AUTH → PLAN
  → RISK×3 (triple confirmation for high-risk actions)
  → EXPORT_DECISION → EXECUTE → REPORT → CLOSE
```

Persistent retry/manual-review/dead-letter queues, HMAC-signed audit trail, transparent error classification (transient vs. permanent).

## 🤖 AI Training Exposure Protection

**In the last 18 months, the AI training landscape silently inverted.** Most users still think "my data might be used for AI someday" — but the policies already flipped. Every major platform you use is, by default, feeding your content to an LLM right now.

| Platform | What changed | When |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **LinkedIn** | Added a default-ON AI-training toggle for all users globally (later rolled back for EU/UK/Swiss/HK/Canada under regulator pressure) | Sept 2024 |
| **Reddit** | Signed a reported $60M/yr data licensing deal with Google; added OpenAI + Anthropic deals | 2024 |
| **Twitter/X** | Every tweet, reply, and like feeds Grok by default. No retroactive opt-out | 2023-2024 |
| **Meta (FB/IG/WhatsApp)** | Used "legitimate interest" to train Llama on all public posts. EU/UK users must file GDPR objection form; US users mostly stuck | 2024 |
| **ChatGPT** | Free/Plus/Pro conversations train future GPT models by default. Team/Enterprise is opt-out | Since launch |
| **Stack Overflow, Tumblr, Medium, Quora, Pinterest** | Varying licensing + per-platform toggles, none surfaced in normal settings flow | 2024-2025 |
| **GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Grammarly, Otter, Notion** | Your code/writing/meetings used for product improvement by default | 2023-2025 |

Commercial privacy services (DeleteMe, Optery, Incogni) **check zero of these**. They're still fighting the 2018 data-broker war.

### What Vanish does for AI

**Two commands, full coverage of 30 platforms:**

#### `vanish ai-scan` — classify your exposure

```bash
# Just list the platforms you use. No personal data transmitted.
vanish ai-scan --chatgpt --linkedin --cursor --gemini
```

Output (truncated):

```
🤖 AI Training Exposure: 100/100 (CRITICAL)

[████████████████████] 4 of 4 likely feed AI models

⚡ Quick wins — 3 easy opt-outs (~2 min total):
  • OpenAI ChatGPT (30s) — https://chat.openai.com/#settings/DataControls
    → Setting: "Improve the model for everyone" → OFF
  • LinkedIn (30s) — https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-generative-ai
    → Setting: "Data for Generative AI Improvement" → OFF
  • Cursor (30s) — https://www.cursor.com/settings
    → Setting: "Privacy Mode" → ON
  • Google Gemini (120s) — myactivity.google.com/product/gemini
    → Setting: "Gemini Apps Activity" → OFF
```

Classification per platform: `exposed` (opted-in) · `licensed` (data already sold to AI — opt-out only affects future) · `safe` (opted-out by default — Claude, Notion AI, Medium, ArtStation) · `action-needed` (policy unclear).

#### `vanish ai-opt-out` — guided walkthrough for each

```bash
vanish ai-opt-out --chatgpt --linkedin --cursor
```

For each platform:
1. Opens the settings page in your browser
2. Prints the **exact UI string** to search for (`Ctrl/Cmd+F` friendly)
3. Step-by-step walkthrough (max 5 steps, verified against current UI as of 2026-04)
4. **Tier overrides** tell you when opt-out isn't needed (e.g., "Copilot Business already opted-out — skip")
5. Records HMAC-signed audit event + schedules **60-day re-verify** (AI platforms silently reset settings after policy updates)

`--clipboard` flag copies the toggle name so you can paste it into the page's find-in-page. `--all` runs through every non-safe platform in one session. `--no-open` for headless/scripting mode.

### The 30-platform catalog

| Category | Count | Platforms |
|----------|------:|-----------|
| 💬 **Chat AI** | 6 | ChatGPT · **Claude** ✅ · Gemini · Copilot · Meta AI · Perplexity |
| 📝 **Social/Content** | 9 | LinkedIn · Reddit 💸 · Twitter/X · Stack Overflow 💸 · Tumblr 💸 · **Medium** ✅ · Quora · Facebook/IG · Pinterest |
| ⚙️ **Productivity** | 5 | Grammarly · **Notion AI** ✅ · Otter · **Zoom** ✅ · Slack |
| 📧 **Email** | 2 | Gmail/Workspace · **M365/Outlook** ✅ |
| 💻 **Dev tools** | 2 | GitHub Copilot · Cursor |
| 🎨 **Creative** | 6 | Adobe · Canva · DeviantArt · Shutterstock 💸 · Figma · **ArtStation** ✅ |

✅ = default opted-out (no action needed) · 💸 = already licensed to AI companies (opt-out affects future training only) · others default opted-in and need manual opt-out.

All data manually verified April 2026. Catalog at [`src/ai-scanner/ai-platforms-catalog.json`](src/ai-scanner/ai-platforms-catalog.json) — each entry is a ~20-line JSON with `defaultConsent`, `optOutUrl`, `walkthrough`, `tierOverrides`, and source notes. PRs welcome for new platforms.

### Why this matters beyond "don't be tracked"

- **Your 2020 Reddit comment is already in GPT-4.** Licensed data doesn't unlearn. Opt-out only prevents FUTURE training rounds.
- **Enterprise plans differ.** ChatGPT Team, Copilot Business, Grammarly Business, Figma Enterprise are all opted-out by default — Vanish's `tierOverrides` field tells you when you don't need to worry.
- **Platforms reset settings after policy updates.** LinkedIn toggled millions of users back ON in Sept 2024. 60-day re-verify catches this before another training cycle.
- **Legal leverage.** The HMAC-signed audit trail is admissible evidence of your opt-out request (relevant for GDPR Article 21 objections, CCPA "Do Not Sell" disputes).

### Advanced AI-era checks (beyond scan / opt-out)

Two deeper AI-privacy tools for power users — both unique to Vanish:

#### 🧠 `vanish llm-memory-check` — is your personal data already memorized?

Modern LLMs don't just "might use" your data — if you've been scraped into pre-training sets, they already **remember you verbatim**. Researchers have shown GPT can complete sentences containing real people's phone numbers and emails.

```bash
# Minimum: just your name
vanish llm-memory-check --name "John Doe"

# Full probe with all identifiers
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  vanish llm-memory-check --name "John Doe" \
    --email john@example.com --phone "+1-555-123-4567" \
    --workplace "Acme Corp"
```

How it works: Vanish sends 15 stalker-style probe prompts to each configured LLM ("What's X's phone number?", "Complete: X's email is...") and checks if responses contain your verbatim identifiers. Output is a **leak rate** per model (0-100%) + which identifier types leaked.

```
🧠 LLM Memorization Test Results

OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
  [████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 3/15 probes leaked (20%) — ⚠️ moderate
  Leaked types: workplace, city

Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku)
  [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0/15 probes leaked (0%) — ✅ safe
```

Uses **your own API keys** (env vars) — Vanish doesn't proxy. Cost: ~\$0.01/scan. `--dry-run` mode runs without API keys for testing.

A zero leak rate doesn't prove you're safe (paraphrased knowledge slips through). A positive leak rate is damning evidence your data was scraped.

#### 📚 `vanish dataset-check` — is your content already in Common Crawl / LAION / Pile?

Even if you opted out of every platform, your content may be frozen in **training datasets that have already shipped**. Common Crawl alone is the backbone of GPT-3/4, Llama, Claude, and Gemini.

```bash
# Real Common Crawl query (actual HTTP call to CDX Index Server)
vanish dataset-check --url https://your-site.com --common-crawl

# All 8 datasets (Common Crawl + walkthroughs for the rest)
vanish dataset-check --url https://your-site.com --all

# Research mode — no network, just walkthroughs
vanish dataset-check --walkthrough-only --all
```

For Common Crawl: Vanish queries the real CDX Index Server across the 5 most recent monthly snapshots and returns per-snapshot hits for your URL.

For LAION (images), The Pile, C4, WebText, RedPajama, Dolma, FineWeb: walkthroughs with exact URLs (`wimbd.apps.allenai.org`, `haveibeentrained.com`, `c4-search.apps.allenai.org`), opt-out instructions (mostly `CCBot robots.txt`), and caveats ("existing distributions cannot be retroactively filtered").

#### ⚖️ `vanish third-party-ai` — AI that OTHER people use on you

Your data gets fed to AI not just by you, but by your employer, doctor, recruiter, and sales contacts — often without explicit consent. Zoom AI Companion, Otter, Fireflies, Gong, HireVue, Abridge, Nuance DAX.

```bash
# Workplace meeting AI objection (EU law)
vanish third-party-ai --context workplace --jurisdiction EU

# AI interview accommodation (Illinois AI Video Interview Act)
vanish third-party-ai --hirevue --jurisdiction IL --company "Acme Corp"

# Medical AI decline (HIPAA)
vanish third-party-ai --abridge --nuance --jurisdiction HIPAA
```

Generates jurisdiction-aware objection letter templates citing:
- **GDPR Article 21/22** (EU) — right to object to processing + automated decisions
- **CCPA / AB-331** (California) — automated decision tool rights in employment
- **Illinois AI Video Interview Act** — mandatory disclosure for AI interviews
- **NYC Local Law 144** — bias audit requirement for AEDTs
- **HIPAA 45 CFR §164.506** — right to restrict AI processing of PHI

Covers 13 tools across workplace / HR / medical. `--output letters.txt` writes them to a file you can email directly.

##### 🔎 Workforce-monitoring sub-scope (`--context workforce-monitoring`)

Reports suggest employers are increasingly deploying **desktop agents that capture mouse/keyboard/screen telemetry specifically to train AI agents on employee workflows** (Meta internal memo, Salesforce "Agentforce" training, similar). This is distinct from meeting-specific AI (Zoom, Otter): it's **always-on desktop monitoring** with explicit AI-training data-use.

Vanish covers 8 commercial agents (**ActivTrak · Teramind · Hubstaff · Time Doctor · Insightful · Veriato · InterGuard · Microsoft Viva Insights**) plus a generic `employer-internal` entry for the "my employer built something they won't disclose" case.

```bash
# Scan THIS machine for which of the 8 commercial agents are installed
# (best-effort — stealth installs evade; but a positive hit is evidence)
vanish third-party-ai --detect-installed

# Detection + BIPA-cited objection letter (Illinois keystroke-biometrics)
vanish third-party-ai --teramind --veriato \
  --jurisdiction US-state-IL-BIPA --company "Acme Corp"

# NY Electronic Monitoring Act disclosure demand + evidence from local scan
vanish third-party-ai --context workforce-monitoring \
  --detect-installed \
  --jurisdiction US-state-NY-EMA \
  --company "Acme Corp" \
  --output workforce-objection.md

# The Meta-memo case: your employer won't disclose what's installed
# → generic disclosure-demand letter citing GDPR Art 88 + Art 15 DSAR
vanish third-party-ai --employer-internal \
  --jurisdiction EU-GDPR-art88 --company "MegaCorp"
```

Four jurisdiction clauses specific to this context:
- **NY Electronic Monitoring Act** (N.Y. Civil Rights Law §52-c, 2022) — requires written notice + acknowledgment before monitoring
- **Illinois BIPA** (740 ILCS 14/) — keystroke-dynamics / mouse-movement biometric patterns, $1,000-$5,000 statutory damages per violation
- **Germany Betriebsverfassungsgesetz §87** — works council (Betriebsrat) co-determination required (clause rendered in German)
- **GDPR Article 88** — employment-context processing proportionality + DPIA required

The generated letter is dual-purpose: (1) formal DSAR-style disclosure demand, (2) explicit objection to AI-training use of your data **regardless** of whether the monitoring itself is lawful for business-necessity reasons. When combined with `--detect-installed`, found install paths are embedded in the letter as a **forensic exhibit**.

⚠️ **Scope boundary**: Vanish does NOT kill processes, block phone-home, or provide anti-detection — that's anti-malware territory. This feature is strictly identification + legal-request generation.

#### 🧹 `vanish clean-ai-history` — where does your AI history actually live?

Every AI tool you use caches conversations somewhere. Some are local (Cursor's workspace cache), some are cloud-only (ChatGPT web), some are both. Wiping "everything" requires knowing every location.

```bash
vanish clean-ai-history --cursor --vscode-copilot --chatgpt
vanish clean-ai-history --all                       # full wipe audit
vanish clean-ai-history --all --local-only          # just files on disk
```

For each tool, Vanish:
1. Resolves the cache paths for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux)
2. Stats what actually exists + approximate size
3. Prints the exact shell command to delete it (**you copy-paste — Vanish never runs rm on your files**)
4. For cloud/web tools: opens settings + prints delete walkthrough
5. Records HMAC-signed audit trail when you confirm you ran the command

Covers 9 tools: Cursor · VS Code + Copilot · Claude Desktop · ChatGPT Desktop · ChatGPT web · Claude web · Gemini · Perplexity · Grammarly. Matches Vanish's safety philosophy from face-scan: we don't handle destructive actions, we show you exactly what to run.

## 👤 Face-Search Exposure Protection

**Upload a single selfie to PimEyes. You'll be horrified.** The site returns every public web page that contains your face — profile photos, conference group shots, articles, social tags, strangers' Instagram backgrounds, and (for unlucky people) adult sites that misidentified them. The underlying tech indexes **billions of images** and is freely available to any stranger with $5.

Real-world damage from face-search brokers:

- **Domestic abuse**: survivors tracked via PimEyes after relocating
- **Stalking**: exes finding current locations via workplace headshots in search results
- **Doxxing**: protesters identified from single photos at demonstrations
- **Warrantless policing**: Clearview AI used by 3,000+ US police departments, no judicial oversight
- **Discrimination**: recruiters reverse-searching candidates' faces to find personal life info

Commercial privacy services (DeleteMe / Optery / Incogni) **don't cover a single face-search broker**. Their entire product is text-based data deletion from people-search sites.

### What Vanish does for face exposure

**Two commands, 8 services covered:**

#### `vanish face-scan` — find where your face appears

```bash
# The essential audit
vanish face-scan --pimeyes --facecheck --findclone

# Free-tier only (skips FindClone which is paid)
vanish face-scan --pimeyes --facecheck --tineye --yandex --google-lens --free-only

# Everything
vanish face-scan --all
```

Vanish opens each service's search page in your browser and prints the walkthrough — **your photo never passes through Vanish**, you upload it yourself on each service. We just tell you:
- Which services have the best coverage for your demographic
- Free vs paid tier differences per service
- Privacy notes per service (e.g., "PimEyes retains uploads 48 hours — use their Private Search toggle or delete after")
- Which jurisdiction hosts the service (matters for your legal opt-out rights)

#### `vanish face-opt-out` — request removal, including Clearview

```bash
vanish face-opt-out --pimeyes --facecheck --clearview
```

Covers **all 8 services including Clearview AI** — the LE-only face database that you can't search yourself but do have a legal right to remove yourself from (CCPA §1798.105 or GDPR Article 17). The walkthrough includes:
- Upload 1-2 photos (front-facing, face visible)
- Government ID verification (where required — Clearview, FaceCheck)
- Exact legal citation text ("I request deletion under GDPR Article 17")
- Platform-specific gotchas (PimEyes has a paid PROtect monitoring service separate from free one-time opt-out)

Each submission recorded with **HMAC-signed audit trail + 30-day reverify** (60 days for Clearview, which is slower). The signed audit is admissible as GDPR/CCPA evidence if the service refuses to delete.

### The 8-service catalog

| Service | Category | Access | Jurisdiction | Coverage |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **PimEyes** | face-search | freemium | global | Most infamous; billions of pages indexed |
| **FaceCheck.ID** | face-search | freemium | US | Growing competitor; romance-scam-detection framing |
| **FindClone** | face-search | paid | Russia | Best Slavic/Russian coverage (VK.com based) |
| **Lenso** | face-search | freemium | EU (Poland) | Newer, GDPR-compliant, smaller index |
| **TinEye** | reverse-image | free | Canada | Exact/near-duplicate image finder (67B+ images) |
| **Yandex Images** | reverse-image | free | Russia | Best general reverse-image + implicit face matching |
| **Google Lens** | reverse-image | free | US | Deliberately limited face matching; good for dupe images |
| **Clearview AI** | face-database | restricted | US | LE-only (not scannable) but has CCPA/GDPR opt-out right |

All data verified April 2026. Catalog at [`src/face-scanner/face-services-catalog.json`](src/face-scanner/face-services-catalog.json). 8-field JSON per service plus `scanWalkthrough` + `optOutWalkthrough` objects with steps/verification/tier-overrides. PRs welcome.

### Why face-search is uniquely damaging

- **Irreversible once indexed.** Removing one photo from one social network doesn't remove it from PimEyes's index. You need opt-out directly.
- **Consent asymmetry.** You never consented to be in Clearview's 40B-image database. They scraped you regardless.
- **No market solution.** The ones that charge you money (DeleteMe etc.) don't cover this. There's no "face-search DeleteMe" — Vanish is it.
- **Legal rights exist but aren't surfaced.** Most people don't know CCPA and GDPR give them deletion rights against even Clearview. Vanish generates the request for you.

## 🛡️ NCII / Unauthorized Content Takedown

For anyone facing **leaked, scraped, reuploaded, or non-consensually-distributed** intimate content. This covers a privacy need that is completely ignored by DeleteMe, Optery, and Incogni — but affects millions of people:

- Content from OnlyFans / Patreon / Fansly pirated onto aggregator sites (coomer.su, kemono.su, thothub, etc.)
- Intimate images posted by an ex-partner without consent (revenge porn)
- Deepfakes depicting you
- Screenshots from paid platforms redistributed on Telegram / Discord / Reddit
- Old content from past careers (sex work, modeling) that you want removed after a career change
- Minor-age content (any content created when you were under 18)

**Commercial privacy services cover zero of this.** Vanish is the first open-source toolkit.

### First thing to do (always): hash-register with StopNCII.org

```bash
vanish takedown --stopncii
```

**StopNCII.org is the single most effective free NCII tool in existence.** Your images **never upload** — hashes are generated locally in your browser, only the hash goes to the registry. Meta (Facebook/Instagram/Threads/WhatsApp), TikTok, Bumble, Reddit, OnlyFans, Pornhub, and Snap all scan uploads against the registry and auto-block matches. Used by 100K+ victims since 2021.

### Second: search engine removal (intimate-imagery form, not general DMCA)

```bash
vanish takedown --google-intimate --bing-removal
```

Google has a **dedicated** form for intimate imagery that processes in 24-72 hours — faster than general DMCA removal. Removes from Search + Image Search + Lens even if the source site refuses takedown.

### Third: DMCA the leak sites

```bash

```

Vanish generates a DMCA §512(c) notice per site with:
- Proper sworn statement + perjury attestation
- Site-specific abuse contact email
- Approach notes ("Send to Cloudflare abuse@cloudflare.com if site refuses")
- Every draft HMAC-signed in audit log (admissible evidence later)

Catalog covers 12 common leak/aggregator sites with varying takedown difficulty ratings.

### Fourth: legal letters when DMCA isn't enough

```bash
# To an ex-partner or individual who won't stop
vanish takedown --cease-and-desist --name "..." --jurisdiction SHIELD

# Pre-suit demand before filing a civil lawsuit
vanish takedown --civil-pre-suit --jurisdiction UK

# Narrative draft for filing a police report
vanish takedown --police-report --state-statute "Cal. Penal Code §647(j)(4)"
```

Jurisdiction flags cite real law: US Shield Act (18 U.S.C. §2261A), Take It Down Act 2025, GDPR Article 17, UK Online Safety Act 2023, Canada Criminal Code §162.1, Australia Online Safety Act 2021. 48 US states have specific NCII statutes — see `cybercivilrights.org/map` for yours.

### Crisis support (built in)

```bash
vanish takedown --support
```

Surfaces:
- **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative** (US): 1-844-878-CCRI — 24/7 hotline + pro-bono lawyer network
- **Revenge Porn Helpline** (UK): +44 345 6000 459 — operator of StopNCII.org
- **eSafety Commissioner** (Australia): statutory regulator with 24h takedown enforcement power
- **NCMEC CyberTipline** (for minors, global): mandatory reporting to all US platforms + FBI

### Privacy guarantees

Vanish stores **nothing** sensitive:
- Your content does not pass through Vanish (ever — you upload to StopNCII / Google directly)
- The list of URLs you target does not persist anywhere
- The list of sites you visited is not logged
- Only the **audit trail** of what takedowns you drafted is persisted, HMAC-signed, and that's kept locally on your machine for YOUR evidence use

**The three commercial services all treat "data brokers" as the full privacy problem.** They haven't added AI training exposure (18 months of default-opt-in policy changes) or face-search broker opt-out (PimEyes, Clearview). Vanish is, as of April 2026, the only tool that covers all three categories.

**Browser-assisted opt-out**: 58 brokers support guided removal via `vanish opt-out`. Vanish opens your browser to the real opt-out URL, pre-fills the data to paste, and guides you through captchas + email verification. Includes the big names (Spokeo, Whitepages, BeenVerified, Intelius, Radaris), background check (InstantCheckmate, TruthFinder), credit bureaus (LexisNexis, Equifax, Experian, TransUnion), and more. See `vanish opt-out --help` for the full list.

**Live HTTP submission**: 8 brokers have adapters for real HTTP submission via configurable endpoints (default `postman-echo.com` for closed-loop validation). The other 202 are dry-run blueprints with verified opt-out URLs — future batches can extend browser-assisted support to more.

## Core Safety Rules (never skipped)

1. **Manual trigger only** — `--manual` flag required, no scheduled mode
2. **Triple confirmation** for any high-risk action
3. **Ask before delete** — export decision gate
4. **User-selected notifications** — no opt-out pressure
5. **Minimum credential scope + shortest TTL + post-task wipe**
6. **HMAC key required in production** — fails loud in dev without `VANISH_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`

---

## Commands

All subcommands work via `vanish <cmd>` (after `npm link` or publish) or `node scripts/index.mjs <cmd>` (local) or `npx -p github:RAMBOXIE/vanish vanish <cmd>` (zero-install).

Commands are grouped by [stability tier](#capability-matrix): **Core** (stable, in hero), **Specialist** (stable, narrower scope), **Labs / Research** (experimental, low-evidence, or UX layers), and **Internal helpers**.

# follow-up for 30-day re-verification.

# Browser-assisted AI training opt-out (opens each settings page + walkthrough)
# For 26 platforms with known UI walkthroughs — prints exact toggle name,
# opens the URL, waits for confirmation, records HMAC-signed audit trail.

# Each walkthrough includes: exact UI string to find, step-by-step instructions,
# tier overrides (e.g., "ChatGPT Team/Enterprise already opted-out"), verification

# required, CCPA/GDPR citation text pre-composed. 30-day reverify default,
# 60-day for Clearview (slower processing). HMAC-signed audit trail.

# Verify whether past opt-out submissions actually worked (30-day re-check loop)
vanish verify                  # check entries past recheckAt date
vanish verify --all            # check every followUp entry (ignore schedule)
vanish verify --broker spokeo  # check specific broker(s)
vanish verify --no-fetch       # dry-run, just list pending

# Verify output: ✅ removed / ❌ still-present / ❓ unknown (captcha/timeout/etc)

# Suggests re-submitting opt-out for still-present brokers.

# Proof report (HMAC-signed audit trail in Markdown)
vanish report ./path/to/execution-result.json

Subcommand shortcut: `vanish-scan` is an alias for `vanish scan`.

### Specialist

```bash
# NCII / leaked content takedown — DMCA + StopNCII.org + Google intimate-imagery removal
vanish takedown --stopncii                     # hash-register (most effective free tool)
vanish takedown --google-intimate              # Google intimate-imagery form
vanish takedown --dmca-letter --all-leak-sites --name "..." --email "..."
vanish takedown --support                      # crisis hotlines + legal aid

# Training-dataset membership — check if your URL is in Common Crawl / Pile / C4 / ...
vanish dataset-check --url https://your-site.com --all
vanish dataset-check --walkthrough-only --all            # no network, research mode

# Third-party AI objection letters (tools OTHERS use on you)
# Generates jurisdiction-cited objection letters (GDPR / CCPA / HIPAA / Illinois AIVIA / NYC LL144)
vanish third-party-ai --zoom --otter --jurisdiction EU    # workplace meetings
vanish third-party-ai --hirevue --jurisdiction IL         # AI interview accommodation
vanish third-party-ai --abridge --nuance --jurisdiction HIPAA  # medical AI decline

# AI conversation history cleanup across Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Claude/ChatGPT Desktop + 5 web services
vanish clean-ai-history --cursor --vscode-copilot --chatgpt
vanish clean-ai-history --all --local-only     # just the files on disk
```

### Labs / Research

⚠️ Labs commands are either experimental infrastructure (`b1-live`), low-confidence research probes (`llm-memory-check`), or UX layers that aren't capabilities themselves (`wizard`, `dashboard`). Read their output as hints, not strong claims.

```bash
# LLM memorization probe — is your personal info already in GPT-4 / Claude?
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env vars (or --dry-run for CI).
# Evidence strength D — a positive signal hints at scraped data, but a clean
# result does NOT prove safety (paraphrased knowledge slips through).
vanish llm-memory-check --name "Your Name" --email "you@example.com"
vanish llm-memory-check --name "Your Name" --dry-run    # no API calls

# Live HTTP submission against a configurable test endpoint.
# ⚠️ Experimental — captchas block real submissions. Default endpoint is
# postman-echo for closed-loop validation. Only Spokeo has a verifiable
# endpoint in MVP; Whitepages/BeenVerified remain dry-run.
# See REAL_LOOP_STATUS.md for the precise scope.
vanish b1-live run --live --brokers spokeo,thatsthem,peekyou \
  --full-name "Test User"

# Full interactive wizard (scan → review → cleanup). UX layer over the
# Core commands above — useful for first-run onboarding, not a capability.
vanish wizard

# Local dashboard (static HTML, no backend) — read-only view of queue state.
vanish dashboard data/queue-state.json
# Open dashboard/index.html in browser
```

### Internal helpers

```bash
# Queue management
vanish queue list
vanish queue retry --id <retryItemId>
vanish queue resolve --id <manualReviewId> --resolution resolved

# Dry-run cleanup with presets (low-level alternative to vanish opt-out;
# requires triple-confirmation flags — most users want vanish opt-out instead)
vanish cleanup --manual --preset spokeo \
  --confirm1 YES --confirm2 YES --confirm3 YES \
  --export-before-delete ask --export-answer no

# B1 runner demo mode (internal test path for the live-adapter pipeline)
vanish b1-demo

# Dashboard auto-refresh (rebuilds dashboard JSON when state file changes)
vanish dashboard:watch

# All 346 tests (109 broker + 19 share-card + 22 ai-scan + 13 ai-opt-out + 23 face-scan + 30 llm-memory-check + 24 clean-ai-history + 20 dataset-check + 44 third-party-ai incl. workforce-monitoring + 31 takedown + 26 verify incl. kind dispatch + 12 Clawhub compliance guard)

See [Capability matrix](#capability-matrix) above. The Shipped / Next / Future timeline below tracks delivery, not stability.

**Shipped (v0.3-unreleased)**:
- ✅ **210-broker catalog** with verified opt-out URLs (up from 23 in v0.1)
- ✅ **58 browser-assisted broker opt-outs** including all 3 US credit bureaus
- ✅ **30 AI platforms** cataloged (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LinkedIn, Reddit, Cursor, …)
- ✅ **26 AI platforms with walkthrough opt-outs** — exact toggle names + tier overrides
- ✅ **8 face-search services** cataloged (PimEyes, FaceCheck.ID, FindClone, Lenso, TinEye, Yandex, Google Lens, Clearview AI)
- ✅ **8 face-search opt-out walkthroughs** including Clearview AI CCPA/GDPR request
